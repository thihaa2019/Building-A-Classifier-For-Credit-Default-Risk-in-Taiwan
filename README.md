# Building a Classifier for Credit Default Risk

This research project paper aims to predict the risk of credit default in Taiwan based on social and economic features. The dataset is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
Logistic Regression was used as the classifier for this model but fine-tuned in four different ways. In the final model, we obtained the highest accuracy using only 14 predictors out of 23 predictors. By performing PCA,
feature engineering and data visualizations, our final model had 81.3 percent training accuracy and 81.2 percent testing accuracy. This project leans more towards
on statistical data analysis and modeling approach rather than fitting with different machine learning/ deep learning model.
